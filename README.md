### AWS
    
##### Deploy Strategy 

- AWS CodePipeline
    - A push to code repository would auto trigger build for the project.  
    - Unit tests are run in CodeBuild.
    - Docker image is created and published to ECR. 
- ECS with Fargate
    - Deploy phase of the pipeline would deploy the newly generated container published in ECR to the already Fargate service.
